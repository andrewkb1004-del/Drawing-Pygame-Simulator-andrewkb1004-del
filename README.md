# Drawing-Pygame-Software-andrewkb1004-del
For this repository, I'm going to be making a drawing simulation in pygame where you can draw lines, squares, circles, and other shapes in picture, while also using different color settings and probably even an eraser or layer setting.  There will also be an option to save the drawing that you made into either a png or jpeg file.
